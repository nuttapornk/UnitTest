When it comes to unit testing a Web API, it is recommended to cover different levels of testing to ensure comprehensive test coverage. Here are the suggested levels for unit testing a Web API:

1.Controller Level Testing: 

At this level, you focus on testing the individual Web API controllers. The goal is to verify the behavior of the controllers in terms of request handling, model binding, validation, and response generation. You can mock any dependencies such as services or data repositories that the controller relies on.

1.Service Level Testing: 

Services are responsible for business logic and act as an intermediary between the controllers and data repositories. Service level testing helps validate the correctness of the service methods, their inputs, and outputs. Here, you can mock the data repositories or other external dependencies that the service interacts with.

1.Integration Testing: 

Integration testing involves testing the Web API in conjunction with its dependencies, such as the database, external services, or message queues. This level of testing ensures that the various components of your application work together correctly. You can use frameworks like Entity Framework Core in-memory provider or Docker containers to set up test databases.

1.End-to-End (E2E) Testing: 

E2E testing involves testing the entire system as a black box to ensure that all components work together seamlessly. This level of testing often involves simulating user interactions through API calls or UI automation tools. Tools like Selenium or Postman can be used for E2E testing.

It's important to note that while unit tests are an essential part of the testing strategy, they should not be the only level of testing performed. Integration and E2E testing are also crucial for validating the overall functionality and behavior of the Web API.

By covering these different levels of testing, you can have confidence in the quality and reliability of your Web API and catch potential issues at different stages of development.
